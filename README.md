# sunglasses-landingPage

This is a static responsive landing page of a fictional company. 


Improvements to be made:
Use the recommended mobile-first method.
Add functionality that closes the drop-down menu when the user clicks outside of the menu.
When Get Started button is clicked the email is saved and the user is taken to another page.
